# AdventOfCode
I attempt Advent Of Code 2016 in C. Binaries are compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 using clang.

The problems can be found at: http://adventofcode.com/

This is intended as a learning exercise to practice solving problems in C.
I'm working through Zed Shaw's 'Learn C the Hard Way' as I solve these,
so the later solutions should be more sensible as I learn more features
of the language.
